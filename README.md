# National Data Infrastructure For Electromobility (DIEMO): Documentation

Electric mobility is a key technology for more sustainable mobility and is one way of achieving ambitious energy and climate policy goals. Electric engines are efficient, and using electricity means that renewable energies can also be used. [recharge-my-car.ch](https://recharge-my-car.ch) is the face of the National Data Infrastructure For Electromobility (DIEMO) and shows where charging points for electric vehicles are available in real time. The data shown in the map is also available as [Open Data](https://opendata.swiss/en/dataset/ladestationen-fuer-elektroautos). This documentation guides you to all DIEMO-ressources.
